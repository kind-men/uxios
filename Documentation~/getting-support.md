# Getting Support

Thank you for using Uxios! We’re excited to support your journey with the library and have set
up [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/kind-men/uxios/discussions) as a place for questions, feedback, and community
interaction. Here’s how to make the most of the support options available.

---

### Where to Go for Help

Our GitHub Discussions section is open for:

- **Questions and How-To**: Post questions about integrating or using Uxios in your Unity project.
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features or share ideas for improvement.
- **Show and Tell**: Share your projects! We’d love to know how Uxios is making your development process easier.
- **Open Discussions**: Join broader conversations, explore best practices, and interact with the Uxios community.

### Using GitHub Issues for Bug Reports Only

To streamline our support efforts, please use **GitHub Issues** exclusively for bug reports. This separation helps the
maintainer focus on bug fixes without sifting through general discussions. You can refer to
our [Submitting a Bug Report](reporting-bugs.md) page for more details on reporting bugs.

### Why Use Discussions?

Our GitHub Discussions create a central place for all Uxios-related topics, allowing everyone to:

- Learn from community discussions.
- Collaborate on features and improvements.
- Showcase unique projects and creative uses of Uxios.

### Getting Started

Thank you for helping us build a collaborative Uxios community! We’re excited to see the conversations and projects that
emerge.
