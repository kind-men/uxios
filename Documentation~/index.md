# An HTTP Client that is<br>powerful and simple

Uxios is a Unity C# library inspired by [Axios](https://axios-http.com/), the popular JavaScript HTTP client. Designed
for use with Unity, Uxios provides an intuitive and consistent API for making HTTP requests, mirroring the ease of use
and flexibility of Axios within the Unity environment. Built to be a part of the JuniSON Engine, Uxios is particularly
optimized for WebGL applications but remains compatible with Android, iOS, and Desktop builds, making it a versatile
solution for Unity projects across platforms.

### A Simple API, for API's

Simplify API interactions with Uxios’s `Resource` wrapper, which provides built-in caching for frequently accessed
endpoints, improving efficiency and reducing redundant network calls.

### Smart Data Conversion

Uxios goes beyond standard HTTP requests by automatically converting data between C# objects, sprites, textures, and
files. From handling JSON responses to downloading images —as textures— or files, Uxios takes care of serialization and
deserialization seamlessly.

fine-grained control over configuration, headers, and advanced error handling, Uxios lets you shape each request exactly
as needed.

send, and manage API calls wherever you need them.
