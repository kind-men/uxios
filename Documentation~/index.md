# Uxios

Uxios is a Unity C# library inspired by [Axios](https://axios-http.com/), the popular JavaScript HTTP client. Designed
for use with Unity, Uxios provides an intuitive and consistent API for making HTTP requests, mirroring the ease of use
and flexibility of Axios within the Unity environment. Built to be a part of the JuniSON Engine, Uxios is particularly
optimized for WebGL applications but remains compatible with Android, iOS, and Desktop builds, making it a versatile
solution for Unity projects across platforms.
