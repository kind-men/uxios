# Submitting a Bug Report

Thank you for helping improve Uxios! By reporting bugs, you help ensure a smoother experience for all users. Here’s how
to create an effective bug report:

## Where to Report

All bug reports should be submitted through the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/kind-men/uxios/issues).

## Important Information to Include

1. **Version Information**  
   Specify the Uxios version where the issue occurred. Bugs may be fixed in newer versions, so if possible, upgrade to
   the latest version and see if the issue persists. Mention the version number clearly.

2. **Detailed Reproduction Steps**  
   Include clear, step-by-step instructions for reproducing the issue. Reproducibility is essential for us to understand
   and troubleshoot the problem effectively. Reports lacking reproduction steps may not be addressed, as this
   information is crucial for identifying the root cause.

3. **Expected and Actual Behavior**  
   Describe what you expected to happen versus what actually happened. This helps clarify the issue and makes it easier
   to track down.

4. **Environment Details**  
   Include information about your development and production environment—such as Unity version, platform (e.g., WebGL,
   Android, etc.), and any relevant configuration settings.

## Why Detailed Reports Matter

Uxios is an open-source project with limited maintenance time. Precise and thorough reports help us manage issues
efficiently and make the most of available resources. When reports include all necessary details, it significantly
reduces time spent on troubleshooting and leads to faster resolutions.

## What to Expect

Once you submit a detailed report:

- We’ll review the issue and confirm reproducibility.
- If necessary, we may request additional information or clarification.
- Accepted reports will be addressed based on priority and resources.

Thank you for helping make Uxios a better tool for the community!
