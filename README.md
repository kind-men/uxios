Uxios is a Unity C# library inspired by [Axios](https://axios-http.com/), the popular JavaScript HTTP client. Designed 
for use with Unity, Uxios provides an intuitive and consistent API for making HTTP requests, mirroring the ease of use 
and flexibility of Axios within the Unity environment. Built to be a part of the JuniSON Engine, Uxios is particularly 
optimized for WebGL applications but remains compatible with Android, iOS, and Desktop builds, making it a versatile 
solution for Unity projects across platforms.

## Why Uxios?

Unity's built-in UnityWebRequest API, while powerful, can be verbose and cumbersome, especially for those familiar with
modern JavaScript libraries like Axios. Uxios simplifies HTTP requests with features like promises, request
interceptors, and cleaner syntax, enabling Unity developers to build data-driven applications more easily. It also
addresses common WebGL limitations by seamlessly integrating with Unity’s async operation framework, offering a robust
alternative for developers looking to expand Unity’s web capabilities.
