Quite a few API's are often referred to as  \u201cRESTful\u201d because it's not a strict standard \u2014 implementations vary in adherence to REST principles, leading to  differences across APIs.</p> <p>Richardson\u2019s Maturity Model, developed by Leonard Richardson and expanded upon by Roy Fielding, categorizes REST implementations into four levels of maturity:</p> <ul> <li>Level 0: The API treats each call as an isolated request.</li> <li>Level 1: The API organizes resources using URIs to represent objects or entities.</li> <li>Level 2: The API uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.</li> <li>Level 3: The API includes hypermedia controls (HATEOAS) to allow clients to dynamically discover actions and   resources.</li> </ul> <p>Uxios is designed to provide out-of-the-box support up to Level 2 of this model through its <code>Resource</code> and  <code>Collection</code> classes, with partial support for Level 3. These classes offer a structured way to interact with resources and collections in RESTful APIs.</p> <p>Let's introduce these two briefly:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Resource: A single entity or object, like a specific user or item. The <code>Resource</code> class in Uxios allows you to   fetch, update, and delete individual resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collection: A group or list of resources, like a list of users or items. The <code>Collection</code> class in Uxios provides   methods for interacting with and managing collections of resources.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Since REST is a flexible framework, Uxios covers many common patterns, but the specifics, such as  Content Negotiation, may require customization. OpenAPI, for example, builds additional standards on top of REST to  provide a more uniform interface that can be added on top of Uxios, but is not provided out of the box.</p> <p>In the following chapters, we\u2019ll explore how to use Uxios\u2019s <code>Resource</code> and <code>Collection</code> classes to interact with RESTful APIs in a structured and effective way.</p>"},{"location":"guides/","title":"Guides","text":"<p>Welcome to the Guides!
